<!--
Listing jekyll posts by tag on one page - http://www.jokecamp.com/blog/listing-jekyll-posts-by-tag/
That is what we need to do under baseurl/all

For the taglayout post we need a baseurl plus the tag...
{% for post in site.categories['news'] limit:5 %}
  <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
{% endfor %}

Finally in the layouts, something has to be done to include spans.
